# Chess_Prototype
 
**Task:** Build a chess board. When you click on one piece an then on a field, it will move there if the move is valid. I attached the fbx files for the chess pieces.


**Achieved:**

   - generating chess board
   - generating 2 chess pieces in random locations of the board
   - highlighting the tiles when hovering over them
   - selecting a chess pieces will show valid moves (exclude tiles occupied by other pieces)
   - after selection clicking on a valid tile will move the chess piece
   - debugging logs

**Possible Improvements:**

   - generating other chess pieces for both white and black
   - additional logic to differentiate between ally and enemy pieces
   - destroying enemy piece with valid moves on click
   - turn based system and UI
   - ai opponent
   - option to play online
